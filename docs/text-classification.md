# Text Classification

## Overview
This section details the datasets available for text classification tasks such as bias detection, sentiment analysis, and toxicity testing.

## Datasets
- **Bias Training Data**: [Download bias-train.csv](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shainar/BEAD/blob/main/1-Text-Classification/bias-train.csv) - Used for training models to detect biased language.
- **Bias Valid Data**: [Download bias-valid.csv](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shainar/BEAD/blob/main/1-Text-Classification/bias-valid.csv)
- **Sentiment Analysis Data**: [Download sentiment-train.csv](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shainar/BEAD/blob/main/1-Text-Classification/sentiment-train.csv) and [Download sentiment-valid.csv](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shainar/BEAD/blob/main/1-Text-Classification/sentiment-valid.csv) - These files include data for training and validating sentiment analysis models.
- **Toxicity Detection Data**: [Download toxic-train.csv](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shainar/BEAD/blob/main/1-Text-Classification/toxic-train.csv) and [Download toxic-valid.csv](https://huggingface.co/datasets/shainar/BEAD/blob/main/1-Text-Classification/toxic-valid.csv) - Focuses on identifying toxic language in text.
